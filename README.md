This is a simple app made with slim framework 4 using the best practices of the wonderful world of php.
We are used to using Laravel and Symfony for everything. But have you ever used a micro framework as a didactic challenge? and an interesting challenge.
The main idea is to make a simple, fast, efficient app with minimal packages.

Let's see what will happen!
